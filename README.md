# habit_tracker_threadbare_version

A simple application that allows a user to create habits with reminders.

I want to build a fully-fledged and full stack version of this application, but I
want to do it in bits and pieces to refresh my coding memory and skills.

## Running

Simply connect an Android devuce using USB or run on an emulator
